# Module 1
This folder contains some of the materials I used to complete the [homework](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2024/01-docker-terraform/homework.md) for [Module1](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/01-docker-terraform) as well as other related exercises or exploratory work.

### Dockerized Postgres and Python data ingestion
Module1 includes setting up Docker containers for a Postgres database and Postgres Admin with Docker Compose. A Python script is then used to ingest csv data into the Postgres database. Postgres Admin is used as an interface to perform SQL queries for analysis. 
### Intro to Terraform and GCP
Module 1 also includes creating a bucket in my GCP project using Terraform. There is a main Terraform configuration file which calls a another Terraform file containing variables defining GCP parameters and credentials.
